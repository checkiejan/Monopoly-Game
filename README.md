## Emphasis on Design Patterns

This Monopoly board game implementation leverages multiple design patterns, ensuring the game is both scalable and maintainable:

- **State Pattern**: Efficiently manages the different states of the game, allowing for seamless transitions and logical gameplay.
- **Strategy Pattern**: Facilitates the different strategies players can adopt, ensuring varied gameplay and dynamics.
- **Factory Pattern**: Aids in creating game objects, ensuring consistency and scalability.
  
These patterns, among others, were instrumental in enhancing the game's design and ensuring code quality.

## Features

- **Multiplayer Gameplay**: Gather your friends and dive into the classic world of Monopoly.
- **Interactive UI**: A user-friendly interface that keeps you engaged and offers a seamless gaming experience.
- **Consistent Game Logic**: Faithful to the original, our Monopoly ensures the rules are upheld, and the game logic remains consistent.
